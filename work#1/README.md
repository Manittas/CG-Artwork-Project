Cameras:
- 1: shows camera 1 on XY plan;
- 2: shows camera 2 on YZ plan;
- 3: shows camera 3 on XZ plan;
- 0: shows camera 4 on prespective with max lengths;

(USE F11 KEY FOR A BETTER VIEWING EXPERIENCE OF THE PROPORTIONS)

Rotations:
- q: rotates cone, sphere and parallelepiped clockwise on Y axis
- w: rotates cone, sphere and parallelepiped counter clockwise on Y axis
- a: rotates parallelepiped in function of sphere clockwise on sphere X axis
- s: rotates parallelepiped in function of sphere counter clockwise on sphere X axis
- z: rotates cone in function of sphere counter clockwise on parallelepiped Y axis
- x: rotates cone in function of sphere clockwise on parallelepiped Y axis

Position:
- up arrow: moves cone, sphere and parallelepiped positively in Y axis
- down arrow: moves cone, sphere and parallelepiped negatively in Y axis
- left arrow: moves cone, sphere and parallelepiped positively in X axis
- right arrow: moves cone, sphere and parallelepiped negavely in X axis
- d: moves cone, sphere and parallelepiped positively in Z axis
- c: moves cone, sphere and parallelepiped negavely in Z axis
- o: resets cone, sphere and parallelepiped original positions

Wires and Axis:
- 4: switches between wired and solid color
- e: turns off and on axis
