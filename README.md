<h1 align="center">CG Artwork Project 2022</h1>

This project was done by a group of 3 in 2022 with an educational purpose for the CG Artwork lecture in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The work was divided into 3 deliveries to which we ended with an overall **A grade** (17.3 in scale grade) for all deliveries together.

We used HTML for the indexes and mainly JavaScript (using THREE.js) for all the different deliveries.

--------------------------------

<h2 align="center">Different Deliveries Done</h2>

Work #1:
- Representing a scene resembling a *Kadinsky* painting incorporating 3 different orthographic views and object movements.

Work #2:
- Creating a scene consisting of a planet, a rocket and several space debries spawning in different positions everytime the index is opened or refreshed. Used object collisions, attached and moving cameras and angular movements for the rocket.

Work #3:
- Representing a scene with several origamis in a podium that can rotate, being able to pause the scene and reset it. Work focused in mesh shadings and lighting, clock functionalities, vr camera incorporated and object modeling (sadly we weren't able to finish the origami pieces properly into the figures we wanted due to lack of time). This last work requires a live server to be used in order to load the material textures.
